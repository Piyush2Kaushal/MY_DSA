//Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods (A, B, and C) and N disks.
//Initially, all the disks are stacked in decreasing value of diameter i.e., the smallest disk
//is placed on the top and they are on rod A. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire 
//stack to another rod (here considered C)

//RULE'S----------------->
// 1 - Only one disk can be moved at a time.
// 2 - Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
// 3 - No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
        let n = 3;
        let s = "A";
        let h = "B";
        let d = "C";
        function hanoi(n,s,h,d){
            if(n==0){
                return;
            }
            hanoi(n-1,s,d,h);
            console.log(`${s} ---> ${d}`);
            hanoi(n-1,h,s,d);
            return;
        }
        hanoi(n,s,h,d);
